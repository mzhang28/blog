Hi there! I'm a masters student at the University of Minnesota advised by
[Favonia][3]. I also currently work as a Software Developer at [AWS][1]
(previously at [SIFT][2]). My computing-related interests lie in programming
language design and formal verification, systems security, cryptography, and
distributed systems.
