# about me

Hi there! I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota, and I've got a wide variety of interests under this field. I've been doing web development for a long time and now I'm looking into security, programming language development, and software development!

Here's some of the languages I like, in approximate order of my skill/confidence in using them:

- **Python** My favorite language by far. Aside from its weakness in performance, I love how the language looks, and I'm currently working on a project that aims to use type inferencing to produce lower-level code.
- **JavaScript** Although I'm trying to step away from JavaScript, I find myself using it from time to time simply out of ease of use and plethora of libraries.
- **Rust** I can't say I'm fluent in Rust, but writing code in Rust just feels right.
- **C** Largely prefer this over C++ because of much finer control over what's happening.
- **Go** I really love this language.
- **OCaml** Learned this from a functional programming class, and I still use it from time to time; I kinda see it as the "Python" of function languages.
- **C++** Good for when I did competitive programming because of its very comprehensive standard library.
