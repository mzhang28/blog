This past weekend, while on my trip to Minneapolis, I completed a very early prototype of "enterprise", a new UI framework I've been kind of envisioning over the past couple of weeks. While the UI framework is mainly targeted at web apps, the hope is that with a bit more effort, native UIs can be produced with almost no changes to existing applications. Before I begin to describe how it works, I'd like to acknowledge [Nathan Ringo][1] for his massively helpful feedback in both the ideation and the implementation process.
