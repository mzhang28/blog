Hi there! I'm a recently-graduated CS bachelor from the University of Minnesota, currently working as an associate researcher at [SIFT][11]. My computing-related interests lie in programming language design and analysis, systems security, cryptography, and distributed systems. <!-- more --> Some of the projects I've been working on in my free time include:

- [**Leanshot**][6], a Linux screen capture tool.
- [**Garbage**][7], a CLI interface to the trash can API.

More can be found on my public [Gitea][2].

I've also started making an increased effort at using and supporting [FOSS][8], and other software that're not predatory towards users. As a part of this effort, I'm also self-hosting and rewriting some of the services and software that I use regularly. Find out what I'm using [here][9].

I'm also an avid rhythm game player and beatmap creator, mostly involved with the free-to-play game [osu!][3]. Check out some of my beatmaps on my [osu! userpage][4].
