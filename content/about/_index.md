Hi there! I'm a recent CS grad from the University of Minnesota, currently
working as an associate researcher at SIFT. I've been doing web development for
a long time and now I'm looking into security, programming language
development, and software development!

In an effort to rely on less services, I started doing a lot of self-hosting
and rewriting of software. Check out some of the projects I'm doing over on my
public [Gitea][2]!

I'm also a beatmap creator for the rhythm game [OSU][3]. Check out some of my
creations on my [OSU userpage][4].
