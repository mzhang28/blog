Hi there! I'm an incoming graduate student at the University of Minnesota. I
currently work as a Software Developer at [AWS][13] (previously at [SIFT][11]). My
computing-related interests lie in programming language design and formal
verification, systems security, cryptography, and distributed systems. <!-- more
--> Some of the projects I've been working on in my free time include:

- [**Leanshot**][6], a Linux screen capture tool.
- [**Garbage**][7], a CLI interface to the trash can API.

More can be found on [this page][12] or my public [Gitea][2].

I've also started making an increased effort at using and supporting [FOSS][8],
and other software that're not predatory towards users. As a part of this
effort, I'm also self-hosting and rewriting some of the services and software
that I use regularly. Find out what I'm using [here][9].

I'm also an avid rhythm game player and beatmap creator, mostly involved with
the free-to-play game [osu!][3]. Check out some of my beatmaps on my [osu!
userpage][4].
