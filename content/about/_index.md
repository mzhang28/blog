# About Me

Hi there! I'm a first-year master's student at the University of Minnesota. I
also currently work as a Software Developer at [AWS] (previously at [SIFT]).
My computing-related interests lie in programming language design and formal
verification, systems security, cryptography, and distributed
systems.

### Research

Currently, I'm learning about [cubical type theory][cubical]. I'll probably
write some blog posts as I learn more. My advisor is [Favonia].

### University Involvement

- **[GopherHack]**. I'm an officer at the GopherHack organization, hoping to
  grow a CTF community at the University.
- **[PL Seminar]**. A group focused on reading and discussing
  programming-language-related papers

### Open-source Projects

Some of the projects I've been working on in my free time include:

- **[Wisesplit]**. A tool for easily splitting the bill with friends.
- **[Garbage]**. A CLI interface to the trash can API.
- **[Leanshot]**. A Linux screen capture tool.

More can be found on [this page][12] or my public [Gitea][2].

I've also started making an increased effort at using and supporting [FOSS],
and other software that're not predatory towards users. As a part of this
effort, I'm also self-hosting and rewriting some of the services and software
that I use regularly. Find out what I'm using [here][9].

### Hobbies

I'm also an avid rhythm game player and beatmap creator, mostly involved with
the free-to-play game [osu!]. Check out some of my beatmaps on my osu!
[userpage].

I also enjoy playing badminton &#x1F3F8; at the rec.
