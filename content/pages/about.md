Hi there! I'm a software developer at Epic Systems in Verona, Wisconsin, and I recently graduated with a Computer Science degree from the University of Minnesota. I've got a wide variety of interests under this field. I've been doing web development for a long time and now I'm looking into security, programming language development, and software development!

In an effort to rely on less services, I started doing a lot of self-hosting and rewriting of software. Check out some of the projects I'm doing over on my public [Gitea](https://git.iptq.io)!

If you want my resume, contact me through one of these means:

## contact
