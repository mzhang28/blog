Hi there! I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota, and I've got a wide variety of interests under this field. I've been doing web development for a long time and now I'm looking into security, programming language development, and software development!

In an effort to rely on less services, I started doing a lot of self-hosting and rewriting of software. Check out some of the projects I'm doing over on my public [Git viewer](https://nobs.mzhang.me)!

### Setup

My setup can be found [here](/pages/setup).

### Languages

Here's some of the languages I like, in approximate order of my skill/confidence in using them:

- **Rust** I can't say I'm fluent in Rust, but writing code in Rust just feels right. Most of my recent projects have been done in Rust.
- **Go** I like the way this language is opinionated, and makes for very clean code. Unfortunately, because of their design decisions it's relatively lacking in language features.
- **Python** One of my favorite languages by far. Aside from its weakness in performance, I love how the language looks. I do have several bones to pick, especially towards its dependency ecosystem.
- **JavaScript** Although I'm trying to step away from JavaScript, I find myself using it from time to time simply out of ease of use and plethora of libraries.
- **C** Largely prefer this over C++ because of much finer control over what's happening.
- **OCaml** Learned this from a functional programming class, and I still use it from time to time; I kinda see it as the "Python" of functional languages.
- **C++** Good for when I did competitive programming because of its very comprehensive standard library.
