          <p name="2c44" id="2c44" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">A lot of websites put <strong
              class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">cookies</strong> on your computer in order to save information
            about your previous visits to the site. The most common use case would be storing a key that would allow
            your computer to auto-login to the site the next time you visited it (rather than forcing you to
            re-login).</p>
          <p name="a1d8" id="a1d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Many sites also put cookies on your computer to
            figure out if you’ve visited the site before, and may change behavior based on whether you’re a new user,
            or you’re a returning user.</p>
          <p name="a6fd" id="a6fd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, take a look at <a
              href="https://www.livingsocial.com/deals/1630304-pokemon-go-course"
              data-href="https://www.livingsocial.com/deals/1630304-pokemon-go-course"
              class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this website</a>. Let’s ignore
            the product that it’s advertising for now and just focus on the “Limited Time Savings” offer on the right
            side. Isn’t it strange how the timer started at 5:00 exactly? In other words, either you were incredibly
            lucky to have visited the site <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">exactly</em> 5 minutes before the offer
            ended, or there’s some other trick they’re pulling.</p>
          <p name="1b3d" id="1b3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It turns out that one of the cookies (I haven’t
            looked into it enough, but if you poke around, you should be able to find it) they store <strong
              class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">on your machine</strong> determines when this limited time offer
            either started or expires. What it means is that the first time you visit the site, the cookie is created
            and you have 5 minutes from that moment to do this purchase. Afterwards, the cookie still exists on your
            computer, so it won’t offer you the deal anymore.</p>
          <p name="49b9" id="49b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But this means that if you get rid of the
            cookie, you can get the 5 minute deal back. If you get an extension such as <a
              href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg"
              data-href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg"
              class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">EditThisCookie</a> that’s able to
            view and manipulate cookies, then you can have a lot better control of what websites are storing on your
            computer.</p>
          <p name="4afc" id="4afc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Some other websites this trick works on include
            <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/" data-href="https://www.linkedin.com/"
              class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a
              href="https://www.quora.com/" data-href="https://www.quora.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor"
              rel="noopener" target="_blank">Quora</a>, which ask you to create an account to view content after the
            first time you visit their site. If you don’t want to create an account, then simply delete any cookies
            they’ve stored on your computer and you will be able to access the site as if it was your first time.
