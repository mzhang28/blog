        <div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn">
          <p name="cbee" id="cbee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you’re participating in CTCTF this week, I
            know it has been a hard week, and I have a huge apology to make, about several things.</p>
          <p name="aa08" id="aa08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I should not have helped out with this CTF. I
            didn’t have much time to work on it, I was busy with school, and it really wasn’t a good time for me to be
            doing it. However, I was really stupid so I decided to jump in anyway.</p>
          <p name="def7" id="def7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong
              class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">If you’re in a rush, and you don’t care about all this stuff,
              skip down to the bottom for the final hint.</strong></p>
          <h4 name="dae6" id="dae6" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Backend</h4>
          <p name="a52e" id="a52e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The website backend problems were completely my
            fault. Things like the problems page saying your problem was unsolved when you actually received points
            for it, or not being able to submit answers for problems because it said “You’ve already tried this.” Part
            of this was not havingenough time to thoroughly test the server and catch all the problems.</p>
          <h4 name="a9f0" id="a9f0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">IRC</h4>
          <p name="6939" id="6939" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This really isn’t my problem. But I’ll address
            it anyway. The biggest problem was the choice of using Pdgn server. It works well for its purpose, and
            does serve all its values. But it was too underdeveloped to use in an actual CTF, lacking features
            including:</p>
          <ul class="postList">
            <li name="c5b2" id="c5b2" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Authentication — people just stole other
              people’s usernames.</li>
            <li name="379e" id="379e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Operators — we lost all ops in the original
              channel <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">and</em> the new channel.</li>
            <li name="033c" id="033c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Connection issues—we got lots of ECONNRESET
              issues with KiwiIRC.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4 name="dd66" id="dd66" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Problems</h4>
          <p name="1114" id="1114" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I don’t know what to say about this. I urged
            the other team members to shorten the duration of the competition to 3 days, but they wouldn’t budge, so
            we ended up having a 7-day competition with only 20 easy problems. My friend said he solved all but 2 of
            them in an hour.</p>
          <p name="e3aa" id="e3aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We weren’t even going to use 1023megabytes
            originally. But because of the immediate lack of problems, I figured we would need it.</p>
          <p name="ebdb" id="ebdb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When the competition started, there were only 18
            questions up. I wrote “3 hard 3 me” in about 15 minutes during class. If you’re running a competition,
            you’d want to keep your participants’ interests as long as possible; there’s no point if everyone quits
            after a day — which is basically what happened.</p>
          <p name="6d7d" id="6d7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I figured the purpose of creating such an
            insanely BS problem was to keep people interested in the CTF, but also to keep the mods (who are on the
            verge of quitting) motivated to keep going. I originally planned to give a lot of hints, and here is the
            last one.</p>
          <h4 name="110a" id="110a" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Hints</h4>
          <p name="a74e" id="a74e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This is the final hint for “3 hard 3 me”: base
            16, base 2, base 3.</p>
          <p name="25ea" id="25ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For 1023megabytes, you probably already made
            some connection between me and a group called the Donut Mafia. Try to find our fundraising website, and
            the flag will be on a userpage.</p>
          <p name="a67a" id="a67a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I feel like I owe this to
            everyone for a bad competition and hope you forgive me for all these mistakes. They won’t happen again. I
            guess I’ll see you guys at the next CTF.</p>
