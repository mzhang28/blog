          <p name="94a6" id="94a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Yep, I’m one of those people. Go ahead and
            judge me, but at least hear me out first.</p>
          <p name="7407" id="7407" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Obviously, the first thing we have to do in
            order to answer the “Is HTML a programming language?” question is to define what a programming language
            is. Let’s literally take the term apart:</p>
          <ul class="postList">
            <li name="ede6" id="ede6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong
                class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">programming</strong>: It’s when you tell a computer what to
              do. For example, I can program a bot to respond to messages while I’m away. Or I can program my phone to
              wake up at 7:30 in the morning. It’s all the same.</li>
            <li name="2b5d" id="2b5d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong
                class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">language</strong>: A standard method of communication that is
              accepted by both the speaker and the receiver. Except in this context, it’s not with humans but a
              machine, so you’re not really speaking.</li>
          </ul>
          <p name="832d" id="832d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Following those definitions, a programming
            language must be a method of communicating to the computers what you want it to do. These are rather loose
            definitions that I came up with, but if you don’t agree with that, you can stop reading now.</p>
          <p name="ecc9" id="ecc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The primary purpose of HTML is to serve as a
            method to display webpage data that is received from the server into a visual representation into your
            browser. That’s just a fancy way of saying “you tell the browser where to put stuff”. Let’s check if that
            satisfies the above points:</p>
          <ul class="postList">
            <li name="d874" id="d874" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">You’re telling the computer how to display
              elements!</li>
            <li name="2ae6" id="2ae6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">You’re using a system of communication that
              both you and the computer understand.</li>
          </ul>
          <p name="fafb" id="fafb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">If you don’t agree that the above two
            demonstrate that HTML satisfies the requirements for a programming language that I laid out above, then
            I’d love to hear your thoughts.</p>
          <p name="fbd3" id="fbd3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So why are people so insistent that HTML is not
            a programming language? Well, here’s some of the reasons I’ve seen so far.</p>
          <ul class="postList">
            <li name="7225" id="7225" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You can’t
              perform arithmetic operations with HTML.” You can’t perform arithmetic operations with HTML because
              that’s not what it was made for. that’s like trying to use a hammer to screw in a screw. Doesn’t make it
              any less of a tool.</li>
            <li name="4e0d" id="4e0d" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li">“It can’t
              process data.” Refer to the first point about arithmetic operations.</li>
            <li name="3e94" id="3e94" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li">“It doesn’t
              produce executable code.” Why not? Let’s say I put this line into an HTML file: <code
                class="markup--code markup--li-code">&lt;br /&gt;</code>. Is it not telling the browser to create a
              line break? Isn’t that making it execute an instruction? Sure, you can say that the HTML isn’t actually
              creating the element, it’s the browser engine. But by that logic, no programming language actually
              exists other than the binary data that the machine is executing, since that’s what’s really executing
              all our code. If you don’t put the elements in, the browser won’t do anything, so HTML is giving the
              browser instructions on what to do.</li>
            <li name="537f" id="537f" class="graf graf--li graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--li">“It’s not
              Turing-complete.” Where did the requirement that programming languages had to be Turing-complete come
              in? Just because your hammer isn’t a Swiss army knife that can do everything, doesn’t make it any less
              of a tool.</li>
          </ul>
          <p name="28c1" id="28c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li graf--trailing">At the end of the day, this is
            all just still my opinion. If you don’t agree, please voice your opinions and convince me otherwise
            (preferably using well-informed arguments)!</p>
