Hi there! 👋

I'm a first-year PhD student (since Fall 2025) at the [Programming Research
Lab][prl] at Northeastern University's Khoury College, advised by [Josh
Gancher][gancher].
My current research direction is designing type systems for choreographic
programming to make it easier to write correct systems and cryptographic
software.
I'm also interested in foundations and development of proof assistants and
compilers, having previously worked with homotopy theory in cubical Agda.
