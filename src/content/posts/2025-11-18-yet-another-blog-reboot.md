I've been meaning to give the blog another fresh coat of paint after starting PhD again so here it is.
I'm using [Astro Micro][1] this time, since maintaining my own theme has become enough of a burden that I didn't really want to deal with it anymore.

I also cut out all the Agda-building, Typst-building and heavy build stuff out of my blog pipeline.
It was getting kind of out of hand, and I figured if I really wanted to produce some generated Agda pages, I could do it as a separate repo.

Another update is I am now using [Obsidian][2] to author notes! I appreciate the clean UI.
I'm hoping this will motivate me to write some more smaller self-contained blog posts.

As for some personal life updates, since my last update I have moved to the Cambridge area!
I am now doing research in choreographic programming languages, as well as taking a course on category theory taught by [Steven Holtzen][steven] and [John Li][john].
