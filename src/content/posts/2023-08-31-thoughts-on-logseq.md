After working for quite a bit I like to catch up with some friends from time to
time, when I made a shocking discovery -- most of them don't really use a
calendar of any sort to manage their lives.

For a while I've always wanted a kind of personal information manager: something
that would put all my information in one place and make it easy for me to query
across apps.
