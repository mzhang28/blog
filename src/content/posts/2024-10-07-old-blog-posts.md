Just re-discovered an [old blog][1] I had written over at Medium from back around 2017.

[1]: https://medium.com/michaels-blog

For completeness' sake I migrated them over to this blog, while still keeping links to the originals.
This means I've been blogging for almost 10 years in total!

I'm grateful that Medium was able to keep this around for all this time.
Even though some of it is quite embarassing to look back at, it's kind of like peering into a time capsule and seeing what I was up to in the past.

I'm also really glad I did a post-mortem of at least one iteration of EasyCTF, since I had stupidly lost all of the actual competition data :frown:

Here are the links to the old posts:
