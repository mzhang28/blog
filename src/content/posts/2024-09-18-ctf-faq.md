There's a lot of foundational stuff that is sometimes not obvious to people who are just starting out in CTF.

### What does nc \<ip\> mean?

For example,

```
nc chal.examplectf.com 12345
```

This is a quick way of saying that a server is running at a specific IP on a specific port.
`nc` stands for netcat, which is a tool that lets you talk to a server through your command line.

> [!admonition: NOTE]
> This also means that the flag is hidden on the server, and will **not** appear in any of the files that have been distributed to you.

In reality, you'd probably only use `nc` to play around with it initially.
You'd probably want to move to using a script soon, because you are usually given a copy of the program to play around with locally.

With vanilla Python, you can open a [socket] and replicate the `nc` behavior with:

[socket]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html

```py
import socket
s = socket()
s.connect(("chal.examplectf.com", 12345))
```

Alternatively, use [pwntools]:

```py
from pwn import *
r = remote("chal.examplectf.com", 12345)
```

### Why do I get a binary and a C file?

The binary is often provided because the specific addresses are meaningful to construct an attack.
Sometimes a libc is also provided to help craft attacks that need specific libc addresses.

Using something like [pwntools] makes it easy to do exploration and perform automated searches for addresses through a binary locally very quickly, and then swap out the target to the server once you've found a method to crack the binary.

### I get some text file with values like N, e, c. What does this mean?

These are usually some values for working with a cryptosystem called [RSA].

[RSA]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)

* $N$ is the modulus. It's part of the public key. It's calculated with $N = p \times q$, but usually $p$ and $q$ are left as private
* $e$ is the public exponent. It's also part of the public key
* $c$ is the ciphertext.
* $m$ (if included) is the message, but this is usually the thing you're looking for

Lots of CTFs will do modified versions of RSA as a puzzle.

> [!admonition: NOTE]
> If the $N$ is just given to you directly instead of in a script, just go ahead and chuck the $N$ into [factordb] to see if it's already been factored!

### I need to quickly convert some data

[CyberChef] is my tool of choice when it comes to this stuff.

### I have a file but I don't know what it is

Plug the file through the [file] command!
It'll tell you what kind of file it is, by looking at the first few numbers. For example:

[file]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_(command)

```
$ file binary
binary: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=62bc37ea6fa41f79dc756cc63ece93d8c5499e89, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

This means it's an executable program.

Another useful tool is [binwalk], which tells you if there's other files packed in there.
This is sometimes useful for some forensics challenges.

### I'm on Windows. What do?

Install [WSL] or [dual boot].
