Yesterday I gave my first talk about type theory at my school's grad student seminar series, about some of the work I had been doing with homotopy type theory and cubical Agda.
Here is a link to the <a href={slides}>slides</a>.

It was a very rushed talk, and a number of things went wrong during the talk, so here's my post-mortem on it from the day after.

First, unexpected things will happen. I had originally practiced my talk for an hour long session, but projector and Zoom issues reduced it by 15 minutes.
I panicked and started rushing my talk, which was already losing people.

Second, I didn't really stop to check that people were following and just continued with my material. I'm not sure if the people watching my talk really understood anything.

Third, I should've recorded the talk.
I just kinda blanked out so much during the talk, it's hard to go back and remember what I said and what I didn't.

It was a good experience, and I hope people at least enjoyed the pizza. :sweat_smile:
