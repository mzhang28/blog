This document presents some intuition for the Yoneda lemma presented in John Li & Steven Holtzen's fall 2025 special topics course [CS7480: Categories for PL][cs7480] at Northeastern University.
The [textbook] introduces notions called $\mathcal{C}$-indexed sets and $\mathcal{C}$-indexed functions in order to present category theory from a more PL-inspired background.
Here I will recontextualize their intuitions in the original language of functors and natural transformations.
This post will assume some basic knowledge in category theory. I'm hoping this is a useful resource for someone who is starting out and is looking for Yoneda-related explainers with examples.

## Why care?

something something motivating universal constructions from set-theoretic concepts

## Yoneda embedding functor

Let's assume we're working with a category $\mathcal{C}$.
