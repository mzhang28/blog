          <p name="d54d" id="d54d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Hi. I’m Michael, a college freshman at the
            University of Minnesota. I love writing code, and I would frequently participate in capture-the-flag (CTF)
            competitions! I might be posting more about those here.</p>
          <p name="138d" id="138d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ll use this space to rant about life. And post
            CTF writeups too (maybe).</p>
          <p name="2f45" id="2f45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I’m really trying to change my
            study/life habits now that I have more freedom. More specifically, going to sleep at 3:00am every day
            isn’t going to work anymore. Recently I started waking up at 6:15am and I think getting things done in the
            morning is even easier than getting things done at night for me. Only problem is the waking up part. I’ll
            try it for a couple weeks and I’ll let you guys know how it goes.</p>
