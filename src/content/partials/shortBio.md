I'm a computer science master's student at the [University of Minnesota][1], advised by [Favonia].
My current research focus for my thesis is cubical type theory and its applications to formalizing mathematical proofs.

I also work as a researcher for [SIFT]. Previously I worked as a software engineer at [Swoop Search] and [AWS].
My computing-related interests lie in programming language design, type theory, formal verification, systems security, cryptography, and distributed systems.

In my past life, I was a CTF hobbyist. I created [EasyCTF], a cybersecurity competition for high schoolers.
I also briefly played with the CTF team [Project Sekai][pjsk].
