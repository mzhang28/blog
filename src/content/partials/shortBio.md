I'm a computer science master's student at the [University of Minnesota][1], advised by [Favonia].
My current research focus for my thesis is cubical type theory and its applications to formalizing mathematical proofs.

I've previously worked as a software engineer at [Swoop Search], [AWS] and [SIFT] in the past.
My computing-related interests lie in programming language design, type theory, formal verification, systems security, cryptography, and distributed systems.
