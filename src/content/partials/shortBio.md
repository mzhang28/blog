I'm a computer science master's student at the [University of Minnesota][1], advised by [Favonia].
My current research topic is in cubical type theory and formalization of the Serre spectral sequence.

I also work as a researcher for [SIFT], specializing in compilers and binary analysis. Previously I worked as a software engineer at [Swoop Search] and [AWS].

Before that, I was a CTF hobbyist. I created [EasyCTF], a cybersecurity competition for high schoolers.
I also briefly played with the CTF team [Project Sekai][pjsk].
