I'm a computer science master's student at the [University of Minnesota][1]
advised by [Favonia]. I've previously worked as a software engineer at [Swoop
Search], [AWS] and [SIFT] in the past. My computing-related interests lie in
programming language design and formal verification, systems security,
cryptography, and distributed systems.
