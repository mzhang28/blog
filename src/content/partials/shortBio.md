I'm a computer science master's student at the [University of Minnesota][1], advised by [Favonia].
My current research is in programming languages and formal methods, specifically cubical type theory and synthetic homotopy theory.

I also work as a researcher for [SIFT], specializing in compilers and binary analysis.
Previously I worked as a software engineer at [Swoop Search] and [AWS].
