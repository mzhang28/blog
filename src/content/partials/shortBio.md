I'm a masters computer science student at the University of Minnesota advised by
[Favonia]. I currently work as a software engineer at [Swoop Search], and I've
worked at [AWS] and [SIFT] in the past. My computing-related interests lie in
programming language design and formal verification, systems security,
cryptography, and distributed systems.
