# About Me

import Intro from "../content/partials/shortBio.md";

Hi there! :wave:

<Intro />

I've also worked as a researcher for [SIFT], specializing in compilers and binary analysis. Previously I worked as a software engineer at [Swoop Search] and [AWS].

Before that, I was a CTF hobbyist. I created [EasyCTF], a cybersecurity competition for high schoolers.
I also briefly played with the CTF team [Project Sekai][pjsk].

## Academic life

I'm currently doing a thesis project for my master's program, involving the mechanization of [spectral sequences] using [cubical] [Agda].
See some of my blog posts to follow along with my research!

### Research projects

- [**cubeviz**](https://mzhang.io/cubeviz/). A visualizer for cubical type theory that can assist with constructing `hcomp`s.
- [**type theory repo**](https://git.mzhang.io/michael/type-theory). The main repository for my Agda code for my research project.

### Conferences and summer schools

History of conferences and academic events I've attended.

- [**ICFP 2024, PLMW workshop**](https://icfp24.sigplan.org/). Milan, Italy.
- **MURI 2024**. Pittsburgh, PA.
- [**Unimath 2024**](https://unimath.github.io/minneapolis2024/). Minneapolis, MN.
- [**OPLSS 2024**](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/summerschool/summer24/). Boston, MA.
- [**Midwest PL Summit 2023**](https://mwpls2023.engin.umich.edu/). Ann Arbor, MI.

### Undergraduate teaching

In undergrad, I worked briefly as a teaching assistant.

- **CSCI 2041, Advanced Programming Principles** with Prof. Eric van Wyk.

### University Involvement

I also love to participate in computing related student groups at the University
of Minnesota. Here's some of the groups that I'm involved with:

- **[GopherHack]**.
  I'm one of the founding officers at the GopherHack organization, hoping to grow a CTF community at the University.
  I prepare material for club activities.
- **[PL Seminar]**.
  A group focused on reading and discussing programming languages related papers.
- **[UMN Kernel Object]**.
  A group dedicated to studying operating system development, created in the aftermath of the UMN Linux kernel controversy.
- **[ACM]**.
  I was webmaster in undergrad and wrote the current ACM website, as well as helping out with other events such as CTF.

Previously, I was also involved with:

- **[SASE]**.
  I was webmaster and was involved in organizing student group events as well.

## Open-source Projects

Some of the projects I've been working on in my free time include:

- **[Wisesplit]**. A tool for easily splitting the bill with friends.
- **[Garbage]**. A CLI interface to the trash can API.
- **[Leanshot]**. A Linux screen capture tool.

More can be found on my public [Forgejo][2] instance.

I've also started making an increased effort at using and supporting [FOSS], and
other software that're not predatory towards users. As a part of this effort,
I'm also self-hosting and rewriting some of the services and software that I use
regularly.

## Hobbies

Outside of computer science, I love cooking, music, and games.
In particular, I'm a huge fan of rhythm games.

Occasionally, I also like to take some time and immerse myself in some random hobby. Here are some things that I have taken interest in before:

- Chess
- Lock picking
- Bouldering
- Craft beer

If you're in the Minneapolis or Twin Cities area, let's chat!
