# About Me

import Intro from "../content/partials/shortBio.md";

Hi there! :wave:

<Intro />

### Research

I'm learning about [cubical type theory][cubical]!
I'll probably write some blog posts as I learn more.

For my master's thesis project, I'm investigating a mechanization of [spectral sequences] in [Cubical] [Agda].
So far, I've been primarily working through the [homotopy type theory book][HoTTBook].

### University Involvement

I also love to participate in computing related student groups at the University
of Minnesota. Here's some of the groups that I'm involved with:

- **[GopherHack]**.
  I'm one of the founding officers at the GopherHack organization, hoping to grow a CTF community at the University.
  I prepare material for club activities.
- **[PL Seminar]**.
  A group focused on reading and discussing programming languages related papers.
- **[UMN Kernel Object]**.
  A group dedicated to studying operating system development, created in the aftermath of the UMN Linux kernel controversy.
- **[ACM]**.
  I was webmaster in undergrad and wrote the current ACM website, as well as helping out with other events such as CTF.

Previously, I was also involved with:

- **[SASE]**.
  I was webmaster and was involved in organizing student group events as well.

### Open-source Projects

Some of the projects I've been working on in my free time include:

- **[Wisesplit]**. A tool for easily splitting the bill with friends.
- **[Garbage]**. A CLI interface to the trash can API.
- **[Leanshot]**. A Linux screen capture tool.

More can be found on my public [Forgejo][2] instance.

I've also started making an increased effort at using and supporting [FOSS], and
other software that're not predatory towards users. As a part of this effort,
I'm also self-hosting and rewriting some of the services and software that I use
regularly.

### Hobbies

Outside of computer science, I love cooking, music, and games.
In particular, I'm a huge fan of rhythm games.

Occasionally, I also like to take some time and immerse myself in some random hobby. Here are some things that I have taken interest in before:

- Chess
- Lock picking
- Bouldering
- Craft beer

If you're in the Minneapolis or Twin Cities area, let's chat!
